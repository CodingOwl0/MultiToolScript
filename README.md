MultiToolScript
A insanely huge batch script for managing your IT infrastructure

This is a script, which i wrote about 4 years ago.
Please note, that the descriptions in the script are in german.

What you can do with it...:
- Execute some DOS Commands easily: Tracert, IPConfig, Ping, ...
- Add new user-accounts
- A very simple IP Scanner (but definetly needs some improvements)
- Change the IP of the computer
- Cleanup of the computer (clears cache, ...)
- Create backups using 7za.exe (by 7zip.org)
... and more ...

The script needs the "data" folder with the 7za.exe-files in it to be able to create backups.

Please use this script at your own risk! 

Feel free, to edit and change this script :)
